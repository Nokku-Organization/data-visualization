Quicksight -> Enterprse addition is a good use-case of big organizations .Because these organizations have multiple readers and few authors. 

#### Reason for opting for Enterprise edition:
- Readers
- Hourly refresh of SPICE data		 
- Secure data encryption at rest
- Email reports

### PRICE:
#### Reader:
    Reader- per user: $0.30/session; 1 session = 30 mins. from login.
    A Reader Session starts with user-initiated action (e.g., login, dashboard load, page refresh, drill-down or filtering) and runs for next 30-minutes. Keeping Amazon QuickSight open in a background browser window/tab does not result in active sessions until the Reader initiates action on page.

    Q)Will a Reader be charged if QuickSight is open in a browser in a background tab?
    A)No, Amazon QuickSight being open in a background tab will not result in usage charges. A session is only initiated when there is explicit Reader activity on the QuickSight web application. If QuickSight is moved to the background or minimized, there will be no additional sessions charged until the Reader interacts with QuickSight again.

    Readers are charged at $0.30/session for the first 16 sessions in a calendar month. The 17th session in the month is charged at $0.20/session, after which there are no more charges for the month. The reader has unlimited access to QuickSight for $5 charge accrued from the first 17 sessions of the month.

    QuickSight users that are Authors receive unlimited email reports as part of their monthly subscription. Readers (per-user pricing model) are billed $0.30 (1 reader session) for each email report they receive, up to the monthly max charge of $5/reader. Each $0.30 charge for an email report also provides the user with credit for a QuickSight session within the calendar month that can be used at any time they log into their account. Readers will have unlimited access to both email reports and interactive dashboards after the monthly max charge of $5/reader.
